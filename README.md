In this repo we have included our project which include the readme. file and the juypitor notebook file and the dataset
# Project title:
Flight delay prediction system
# Project description
Flight delays are a major problem in civil aviation and happens every day, sometimes very unexpectedly.So to solve this problem of flight delay we have done some of our contribution so that people do not need to wait long at the airports and their time should not be spoiled.
The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that may contribute to flight delays and to predict the flights arrival and their delay time. The accurate prediction of flight delays is of great significance to airports, airlines and passengers. Predicting delays will help an airport to adjust resource allocations, quickly analyze the causes, and take measures to reduce or eliminate delays. It can also help the passengers to avoid wait at the airports.
